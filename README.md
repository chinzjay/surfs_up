# Surfs_Up Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to gather data about temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the Surf and Ice Cream business is sustainable year-round.
## Results
 - **Analysis for the month of June**
 
     The temperatures for the month of June was filtered and converted to a list. A DataFrame was then created from the list of filtered temperature data. The summary statistics      was then generated for the June temperature DataFrame *(Fig 1)*.

    The following observations were made from temperature statistics for the month of June
     - The average temperature is 74.94.
     - The minimum temperature is  64.00.
     - The maximum temperature is 85.00.
     - 1700 data points has been studied for the above statistics.
    
    
 - **Analysis for the month of December**
 
    A dataframe was created from the list of temperature data for the month of December. The summary statistics was then generated for the December temperatures DataFrame *(Fig     2)*.

    The following observations were made from the December statistics.
      - The average temperature is 71.04.
      - The minimum temperature is  56.00.
      - The maximum temperature is 83.00.
      - 1517 data points has been studied for the above statistics.

## Summary
It is evident from the above results that the average temperature is in 70's during the month of June and December. The maximum temperature of both the months are in the 80's. Based on the above anlaysis we can say that Surf and Ice Cream business is sustainable in Oahu year around.
The following addditional queries can be made to get far more insights before opening the business.
  - The temperature can be grouped by year to identify patterns for changes in weather.
  - The count of minimum temperature for the different months can be analyzed to further understand the temperature patterns.
